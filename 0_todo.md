## Detector
    - maximum counts per pixel (count rate)
    - what about the gaps between the modules (does it result in some sort of kinks during the integration?)
    - what reset intervals to chose (should not interfer with experimental timings)
    - how long do the experiments take
    - does the detector need to be reset in between sets?
    - ...

## shopping list
    - capillarys
    - hy-lok
    - ceramics
    - Steckdosenadapter
