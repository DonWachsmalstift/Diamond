> We had major problems to clean, because the glue had glued the glass capillary, the seal and the metal joint to the thermocouple.
No gas flow was possible through the cap, all blocked. It took 2 hours to clean by soaking in ethanol and gently scrape off glue from thermocouple! <br>

After cleaning slow heating of thermocouple

Gas flows checked: Nominal 20 mL/min He gave ~ 10 mL/min on the flowmeter; for H2, nominal 10 mL gave ~ 4.4 mL/min on the flowmeter
