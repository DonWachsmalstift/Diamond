> We had major problems to clean, because the glue had glued the glass capillary, the seal and the metal joint to the thermocouple.
No gas flow was possible through the cap, all blocked. It took 2 hours to clean by soaking in ethanol and gently scrape off glue from thermocouple! <br>

After cleaning slow heating of thermocouple

Gas flows checked: Nominal 20 mL/min He gave ~ 10 mL/min on the flowmeter; for H2, nominal 10 mL gave ~ 4.4 mL/min on the flowmeter

## Ni@La2O3-CeO2 ##
**10:34** mounting of new sample
flushing with He 10 mL/min nominally (i.e. 3.5 mL/min) <br>
- #55414: test image "test_Ni@La2O3CeO2", set filter to 50 %, 30 sec
- moved sample by 1 mm
- #55415: test image "test_Ni@La2O3CeO2", set filter to 50 %, 30 sec; both images have 25,000 cts. Therefore, we set filter manually to 10 % to prevent afterglow. <br>
  this curve contains small additional peaks of unclear origin.
  **NiO peaks at 2.5, 3, 4.1, 4.5, 5, 5.2, 5.9, 6.15 A-1**
  **Ni peaks at 3.1, 3.6, 5.1 A-1**
  
- **#55416: "reduction_Ni@La2O3CeO2" start at 10:44**, hydrogen set to 60 mL/min, heat ramp of 10 K/min to 600 °C started in frame 4;
- in frame 23 H2 flow changed to 40 mL/min nominally to prevent powder compression; the powder shifted in the capillary towards the thermocouple; slight increase in intensity of PXRDs over the first frames could possibly be due to more powder being pushed by the gas flow into the beam position;
- we aborted at T = 180 °C due to foreign peaks
- #55417: test image
- moved by 1 mm back, test image - again without foreign peaks
- H2 flowed the entire time
- **#55419: reduction_Ni@La2O3CeO2" restarted at 11:21**
- transformation of NiO to Ni ~ frame 45

laid into flow cell, i.e. no ideal height positioning. Capillary likely not hit in middle
