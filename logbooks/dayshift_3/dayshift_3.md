> We had major problems to clean, because the glue had glued the glass capillary, the seal and the metal joint to the thermocouple.
No gas flow was possible through the cap, all blocked. It took 2 hours to clean by soaking in ethanol and gently scrape off glue from thermocouple! <br>

After cleaning slow heating of thermocouple

Gas flows checked: Nominal 20 mL/min He gave ~ 10 mL/min on the flowmeter; for H2, nominal 10 mL gave ~ 4.4 mL/min on the flowmeter

> Mirijam always took point number and Felix frame number when we referred to frames (so about all frame allocations for start of heating ramps are point numbers)

## Ni@La2O3-CeO2 ##
**10:34** mounting of new sample
flushing with He 10 mL/min nominally (i.e. 3.5 mL/min) <br>
- #55414: test image "test_Ni@La2O3CeO2", set filter to 50 %, 30 sec
- moved sample by 1 mm
- #55415: test image "test_Ni@La2O3CeO2", set filter to 50 %, 30 sec; both images have 25,000 cts. Therefore, we set filter manually to 10 % to prevent afterglow. <br>
  this curve contains small additional peaks of unclear origin. <br>
  **NiO peaks at 2.5, 3, 4.1, 4.5, 5, 5.2, 5.9, 6.15 A-1** <br>
  **Ni peaks at 3.1, 3.6, 5.1 A-1**
  
- **#55416: "reduction_Ni@La2O3CeO2" start at 10:44**, hydrogen set to 60 mL/min, heat ramp of 10 K/min to 600 °C started in frame 4;
- in frame 23 H2 flow changed to 40 mL/min nominally to prevent powder compression; the powder shifted in the capillary towards the thermocouple; slight increase in intensity of PXRDs over the first frames could possibly be due to more powder being pushed by the gas flow into the beam position;
- we aborted at T = 180 °C due to foreign peaks
- #55417: test image
- moved by 1 mm back, test image - again without foreign peaks
- H2 flowed the entire time
- **#55419: reduction_Ni@La2O3CeO2" restarted at 11:21**
- transformation of NiO to Ni ~ frame 45
- 12:50: only at 500 °C
- heat ramp adjusted for catalysis during frame 199, cooling to 350 °C with 10 K/min (programmed to 330 °C because of offset of thermocouple)
- frame 264: catalysis started with 4:1 H2:CO2 (nominally 48 mL/min H2 : 12 mL/min CO2) at 13:32
- frame 329: change to 3:1 (nominally 45 mL/min : 15 mL/min) at 14:05
- frame 393: change to 2:1 (nominally 40 mL/min : 20 mL/min) at 14:36
- aborted in frame 453, because we haven't programmed enough frames to finish the last catalysis and re-activation
- **#55420**: change to 1:1 (nominally 30 mL/min : 30 mL/min) at 15:07
- **frame 54: re-activation with change to pure H2, heat ramp started to 600 °C with 10 K/min** and H2 flow set to nominal 60 mL/min in frame 59 at ~15:36
- by the pure H2, all Bragg peaks shift to smaller Q; the PXRD of the sample before the first catalysis (#55419, frame 260) had also Bragg peaks at Q values a bit smaller than during all catalysis runs and the Bragg peaks of the activation in H2 (#55419, frame 190) at highest T coincide in position with the peaks during re-activation; the Bragg peaks stayed at their positions during the catalysis at constant temperature.
- **frame 126: cooling down to 350 °C** at 16:07, because over 20 min the Bragg peak position remained unchanged
- since measured temperautre is only 500 °C, cooling will only set in after 10mins (10 mins = 100 °C), i.e. 126 + 2 x 10 = 146
- in ~ frame 155 a Bragg peak shift to slightly higher Q values is observed, previous datasets remained unchanged in peak positions; so the peak shift is associated with temperature
- **frame 185: set to 60 mL/min CO2**: Bragg peaks shifted within 4 frames to higher Q values as observed during catalysis before
- **frame 216: set to 60 mL/min H2** and 0 CO2: Bragg peaks (of oxides) moved back to position of previous catalysis, while those Bragg peaks in only CO2 were shifted to slightly larger Q values
- frame 236: heating stopped and measurement aborted

## ex-situ capillaries ##
2 mm capillaries are attached with "Kinderknete" to flow cell, i.e. no ideal height positioning. Capillary likely not hit in middle.
14 capillaries of high priority
CTFs and Fabio's samples can be left with Phil Chater


- **VS111-1000**/IEK-9: 1 mm cap mounted; <br>
  #55421 "test_VS11-1000" X-ray above capillary; #55422 hit sample, probably with a lot of glass at thicker end of capillary; afterglow from experiment before? but no peaks from ; <br>
  dark taken; <br>
  #55423 and #55424 still contain small sharp peaks --> must come from sample
  #55424 and 55425 with 2 mm capillary for 30 sec
  **#55426** with 2 mm cap for 3 min

- **AK150-600**/IEK-9: #55428 test shot with 10 sec; #55429 with 30 sec
- **empty cap IEK9 of AK150-600**: because we cannot find the 2 mm empty cap, we measure the end of the AK160-600 sample cap which looks pretty empty #55430, 
  
- **AK152-800**/IEK-9: **#55431** for 5 min --> the noise in the AK150-600 dataset of 3 min was similar at high Q to the noise in the AK152-900 dataset of 5 min --> we continue with 3 min per sample
- **empty cap of AK152-800**: **#55432** for 3 min

- **PAN Pulver 1000 °C**/IEK-9: **#55433** for 3 min "PAN_Pulver1000"
- **empty cap of PAN Pulver 1000**: **#55434** for 3 min
- **AK172-1500**/IEK-9: **#55435** for 3 min
- **AK153-900**/IEK-9: #
- **AK151-700**/IEK-9: #
- **PAN Pulver 800 °C**/IEK-9: #
- standard: #


to be measured in flow cell, because then we can possibly flow H2 through the STFN_700 or STFN_S-900 if there is only NiO  <br>
