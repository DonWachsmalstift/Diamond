## Comments
- **03:30 AM:** Still haven't started measuring. We are convinced that not pelletizing the samples and using a press for the samples was a *huge mistake*. Did we ever try these samples in the setup at the **IFK**?
- **03:45 AM:** We applied cyanoacrylate glue to a new sample with *almost no powder* inside. It seems to be *reasonably tight*. Waiting for the glue to dry.

> **Note:** Remember to double-check the setup at the IFK before proceeding further. It's crucial to avoid any potential issues.

- **04:00 AM:** The Beam Monitor is not showing any intensity. We are attempting to run the experiment, but there is no beam available.
- **04:40 AM:** Start of Measurment Reduction. Mono correction was turned off Phil fixed the issue remotely
