- **20:30:** 
  - Start of shift
  - Cu@HBea T = 450°C reached of Calcination
- **21:30:**
  - end of Calcination, Start He Flush
- **21:45:**
  - Start of reduction H2 set to 60 ml/min, POS2 needed to be used So we switched to POS2
  - Reduction kinetics seems too fast within 2 min no more changes
- **22:15:**
  - 16:4 H2:CO2 Started
- **22:30**
  - He flushing
- **22:50:**
  - Air flusing 20 ml/min
- **23:05:**
  - 55401
  - Started rereduction at 15sec per frame and 350°C 
  - slower reoxidation revealed intermediate species we didnt see before
- **23:50:**
  - Sample changed to La1Ce3Ni2O8 
- **00:00:**
  - 55402
  - Start of Reduction of La1Ce3Ni2O8 max reached was 525°C
- **01:40:**
  - Cooling down to 350°C 
- **03:00:**
  - 55404
  - Catalysis done, PCA reveals no structural changes, only beam current is changing intensity
- **03:42:**
  - 55405
  - Catlysis 3:1 H2:CO2 we end it prematurely, still no changes, we will skip ahead to 1:1 ratio now. And prepare drop-outs of H2
- **03:50:**
  - 55406 1:1 Ratio
  - we observe something like rexodition
- **04:20:**
  - 55407
  - Starting Rereduction for 30 min including ramp
  - 50°C/min ramp from 350°C to 600°C
- **04:50:**
  - 55408 - 55413    
  - Methantion Drop-out cyclces at 350°C each lasting 15min
  - Methanation 1 Sucsessfull
  - Drop-Out 1 still had H2 turned on was restarted from first dropout 
## Todo
- Plot MS data
  - we couldnt figure out how to get the data off from the laptop
