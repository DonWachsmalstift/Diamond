thermocouple was somewhat away from sample; hence, T(sample) > T(thermocouple) by ca. 100 °C during calcination 
  --> thermocouple needs to be set to an estimated 250 °C for cooling down to have 350 °C
  --> reprogrammed by Benjamin and Felix 

**7:42** data collection started for cooling down "Cool down to catalysis" #55379

> technician came in at 7:52 to refill cryo to 70 %
