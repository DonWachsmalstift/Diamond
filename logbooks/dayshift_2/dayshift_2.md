## summation of missed beamtime due to mono problems ##
07.07.
- no setup until 14 o'clock
- no measurement started before 22 o'clock
- mono problems in the night <br>

08.07.:
- 08:30 mono went off when first catalytic cycle started


## start of day shift at 7:30##

thermocouple was somewhat away from sample; hence, T(sample) > T(thermocouple) by ca. 100 째C during calcination <br>
  --> thermocouple needs to be set to an estimated 250 째C for cooling down to have 350 째C<br>
  --> reprogrammed by Benjamin and Felix <br>

**7:42** data collection started for cooling down "Cool down to catalysis" #55379<br>
T equilibrated in thermocouple at 250 째C<br>
data collection aborted at 8:20<br>

> technician came in at 7:52 to refill cryo to 70 %

**8:21** catalysis started #55380 with frame time 30 s, potential run time of 3*60*2 = 3 h and gas ratio of 0.5 mL He, 16 mL H2, 4 mL CO2
intensity is gone, f was set to 100 %<br>
when looking at PCA1, this component decreases strongly; the intensity in the colour plot of the highest peak also decreases --> correlates likely with mono failur <br>
abort 8.32 last frame 23 <br>

catalysis still running

**8:39** exposure #55381 with 13 frames, no intensity --> Phil contacted<br>
distance between vales below "RGA3" was red, Phil phoned then it went black again<br>
individual exosure #55382 with one frame with no intensity<br>
optics tube between GV2 and JGV1 went red again, then also the tube between JGV1 and JGV2<br>

**8:57** Phil phoned that mono went off, catalysis was stopped and hence was running for ca. 35 min

> #! several powder rings are burnt into the detector --> adjust measurement strategy to have some sleep time for longer runs
