thermocouple was somewhat away from sample; hence, T(sample) > T(thermocouple) by ca. 100 째C during calcination 
  --> thermocouple needs to be set to an estimated 250 째C for cooling down to have 350 째C
  --> reprogrammed by Benjamin and Felix 

**7:42** data collection started for cooling down "Cool down to catalysis" #55379
T equilibrated in thermocouple at 250 째C
data collection aborted at 8:20

> technician came in at 7:52 to refill cryo to 70 %

**8:21** catalysis started #55380 with frame time 30 s, potential run time of 3*60*2 = 3 h and gas ratio of 0.5 mL He, 16 mL H2, 4 mL CO2
intensity is gone, f was set to 100 %
abort 8.32 last frame 23 

catalysis still running

**8:39** exposure #55381 with 13 frames, no intensity --> Phil contacted
distance between vales below "RGA3" was red, Phil phoned then it went black again
individual exosure #55382 with one frame with no intensity
optics tube between GV2 and JGV1 went red again, then also the tube between JGV1 and JGV2

> #! several powder rings are burnt into the detector --> adjust measurement strategy to have some sleep time for longer runs
